Cuba and Venezuela continued to provide permissive environments for terrorists.  In Venezuela, individuals linked to FARC dissidents (who remain committed to terrorism notwithstanding the peace accord) and the ELN, as well as Hizballah sympathizers, were present in the country.  Nicolas Maduro has openly welcomed former FARC leaders who announced a return to terrorist activities.  Members of the ELN who were in Havana to conduct peace talks with the Colombian government since 2017 also remained in Cuba.  Cuba, citing peace negotiation protocols, refused Colombiaâ€™s request to extradite 10 ELN leaders after that group claimed responsibility for the January 2019 bombing of a Bogota police academy, which killed 22 and injured 87 others.  Multiple fugitives who committed or supported acts of terrorism in the United States also continued to live freely in Cuba.
