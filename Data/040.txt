Several countries in the region took steps in 2019 to designate Hizballah as a terrorist organization.  Argentina developed a new sanctions regime and used it to designate the entirety of Hizballah and individuals specifically connected to the 1992 and 1994 bombings of the Israeli Embassy and Argentine Israelite Mutual Association Jewish community center in Buenos Aires.  Paraguay designated terrorist organizations and individuals, in particular targeting Hizballah, and is identifying possible sanctions against designated entities.  In October, Venezuela’s democratically elected National Assembly designated Hizballah as a terrorist organization, along with other groups including ISIS and ELN.  In Peru, the government continued efforts to retry Hizballah operative Muhammad Ghaleb Hamdar after a Peruvian court previously acquitted him of terrorism charges in 2017.

Argentina hosted the Second Western Hemisphere Counterterrorism Ministerial in July, which included 18 participating countries.  At the Ministerial, countries affirmed that ISIS, al-Qa’ida, and their affiliated organizations were a terrorist threat, expressed concern about Hizballah activities in the hemisphere, and recognized ELN as a threat to regional stability.  At the Ministerial, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and the United States established the Regional Security Mechanism (RSM).  The RSM – a reconstituting of the previous “3+1” initiative – focuses on the threats of transnational crime and terrorism in the region.  In November 2019, the RSM held its first experts meeting in Asuncion, Paraguay, bringing together officials from intelligence, law enforcement, border security, financial intelligence, financial regulatory, and foreign affairs agencies from the four member countries.
