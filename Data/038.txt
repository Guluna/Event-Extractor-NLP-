In 2019, the Lebanon-based and Iran-backed terrorist group Hizballah continued its activity in the Western Hemisphere, including its use of supporters and financiers who operate in the Tri-Border Area (TBA) of South America, where Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay meet.  The United States continues to be vigilant about individuals affiliated with international terrorist groups, including al-Qaâ€™ida and ISIS, who have made attempts to exploit the region.  These include a suspected AQ operative in Brazil, about whom the FBI issued a public notice in August, as well as ISIS supporters and sympathizers in a number of countries including Canada and Trinidad and Tobago.  Meanwhile, regional terrorist groups, such as the National Liberation Army (ELN) and Shining Path, were active in the hemisphere, including in Colombia, Venezuela, and Peru.  In Colombia, an estimated 2,600 Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) dissidents who never demobilized, left the peace process, or are new recruits, continued violent attacks, primarily to enable narcotics trafficking and other criminal activities.  While travel of FTFs from the Western Hemisphere to conflict zones was limited in 2019, the potential return of these battle-tested terrorists remained a concern.
