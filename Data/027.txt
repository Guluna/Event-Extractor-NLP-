On March 15, 2019, a gunman carried out and live-streamed a terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.  Fifty-one people were killed, 50 more were injured, and the livestream was viewed around 4,000 times before being removed by technology companies.  Two months later, a group of government leaders and major online service providers adopted a non-binding pledge – the Christchurch Call to Action to Eliminate Terrorist and Violent Extremist Content Online (Christchurch Call) – to prevent terrorist use of the internet.  The United States did not endorse the Christchurch Call due to policy and legal concerns, but it supports the overall goals and continues to work with international partners to counter the use of the internet for terrorist purposes.  This was illustrated by U.S. endorsement of the 2019 G20 Osaka Leaders’ Statement on Preventing Exploitation of the Internet for Terrorism and Violent Extremism and the 2019 G-7 Biarritz Strategy for an Open, Free and Secure Digital Transformation, among others.
