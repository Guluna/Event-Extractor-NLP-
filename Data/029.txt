Several European countries took concrete steps to combat Iranian regime-backed terrorism in 2019.  Albania, Denmark, and France all reduced diplomatic relations in response to Iran-backed plots to conduct assassinations or bombings in those countries.  These plots in the heart of Europe illustrate the global reach of Tehran’s terrorist capabilities.  In response to Iran’s terrorist plotting in Europe, the United States in 2019 launched the Countering Transnational Terrorism Forum (CTTF), bringing together law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and financial practitioners from more than 25 countries to disrupt Iranian terrorist activities and networks.  Numerous European nations also continued to participate in the U.S.-Europol Law Enforcement Coordination Group (LECG) to counter Hizballah’s terrorist and illicit activities around the world.  The LECG met twice in 2019.
