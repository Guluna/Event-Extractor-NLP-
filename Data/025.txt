In the broader Sahel region, terrorist groups have expanded their operations in north and central Mali and the Tri-Border Region of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger.  These include affiliates of al‑Qa’ida and ISIS, such as Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM) and ISIS-Greater Sahara (ISIS-GS), respectively, as well as non-aligned groups.  The number of attacks in the Western Sahel region increased 250 percent since 2018.  Partner countries remain strong willed against terrorism but lack the means to contain or degrade the threat on a sustained basis.  The G5 Sahel Joint Force (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger) was launched in 2017 to coordinate counterterrorism operations among member countries.  The G5 Sahel is not yet capable of disrupting the growing terrorist footprint across the Sahel but has potential as a coordination mechanism.  France’s Operation Barkhane, with 5,200 troops on the ground, plays a crucial role in countering terrorist groups and promoting a level of basic security, as does the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA).
