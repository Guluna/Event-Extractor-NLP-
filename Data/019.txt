In areas retaken from the anti-government groups, including Eastern Ghouta, Daraa and southern Damascus, Syrian security forces arrested hundreds of activists, former opposition leaders and their family members, although they had all signed reconciliation agreements with authorities guaranteeing that they would not be arrested. 

Tens of thousands of persons have been detained or disappeared since 2011, the vast majority by government forces. Thousands died in Syrian government custody from torture and horrific detention conditions. In 2019, the government updated the records of hundreds thought to be disappeared or dead, but none of their families have received their loved ones’ remains or additional information from authorities.

Hay’et Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an al-Qaeda affiliate predominantly active in Idlib, arbitrarily arrested numerous residents in areas under its control. In January 2019, Human Rights Watch documented 11 arrests; in six of the cases, individuals were apparently tortured. Local rights groups have gathered files or evidence on hundreds of other cases.

ISIS seized thousands of individuals, including activists, humanitarian workers, and journalists, whose fate remained unknown, according to local human rights monitors and families of those kidnapped. Neither the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Syrian government nor the US-led international coalition have created mechanisms to handle families’ queries.

In May 2019, Human Rights Watch was among eight Syrian civil society and international human rights organizations that called on UN Security Council member states to urgently address the widespread arbitrary detentions, kidnapping, torture and other-ill treatment, and enforced disappearances of tens of thousands of Syrians at the hands of the Syrian government, armed anti-government groups, and ISIS.
